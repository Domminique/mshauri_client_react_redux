mshauri is a multiplatform multilingual scalable platform for all mentoring models that you need and provides the most affordable pricing in the market.

### List a few main features:

- Managers can upload mentor and mentees in pdf, json or excell data formats

### List roles of typical users:

## 2a. Writing user personas

Ibrahim is a busy working project Manager who wants to access Mshauri and make sure that he can see all mentoring activities of his Program. He also uses mshauri to see engagement reports, detailed meeting lists, graphics, custom reports. He also uses the mobile app to automate meeting and calls with mentors and mentees. Ibrahim wants to save time and money, and he wants a mentors Management platform that gives his time back.

Dominic is a mentor and a busy start-up founder who wants to send direct messages or join video calls his mentees and to explore tools that will save him time and learn in the process . Dominic likes to perform all operations on her phone.

## 2b. Writing user stories

Search for for Mentors and mentees

As a Program Manager , I want to search for mentors and mentees of my mentoring program , see engagement reports, detailed meeting lists, graphics, custom reports of all mentoring activities.

Check useful graphics
As a Mentor, I want to Check useful graphics to measure my mentoring program.

## 3. Defining SLIs and SLOs

#### userstory SLI

Check useful graphics

#### SLO

1. available 99.95%
2. 5% of requests complete in under 300 ms

#### SLI

1. Fraction of 200 vs 500 HTTP responses from
   API endpoint measured per day
2. Time to last byte GET requests measured
   every 10 seconds aggregated per minute

## 4. Design microservices for your application

### Service , http, TCP(yes), UDP

## 9. Diagramming your network

### diagram that depicts how your services will communicate over the network. Include regions, zones, load balancers, CDN, and DNS if applicable

## 10. Designing reliable, scalable applications

### Even if some service is down, we want the web frontend of our application to be available nearly all the time. We also want the website to be fast with very low latency to users all over the world. On the next slide, draw a diagram that depicts how we can achieve this using Google Cloud services.

## 11a. Disaster recovery scenario

### We've deployed for high availability by replicating resources in multiple zones. However, to meet regulatory requirements, We need a plan to recover from a disaster that brings down the entire region. The current architecture is depicted below.So we create a plan to bring up your application in another region if our main region is down.
